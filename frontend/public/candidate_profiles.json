Now, I am so grateful for the field of coding, as it aligns perfectly with my skills and interests. \n\nToday I am looking for jobs in back-end development. I enjoy all parts of coding and especially in logically intense ones. I have found C# and the .NET framework most interesting.

    "about": "After completing my studies, I made the bold decision to move from the Netherlands to Sweden. Having already studied in Sweden for 6 months, I knew my international journey wasn‚Äôt over. I wanted to gain global work experience, immerse myself in a different working culture, and explore new paths. This move wasn‚Äôt easy, but it helped me grow, adapt to new environments, and discover new passions. It shaped my independence, maturity, and how I approach challenges.\n\nWhat drives me is my passion for data and the discipline to keep pushing until I find the right path. Through careful planning and organization, I create structure for myself that enables productivity. I don‚Äôt take things at face value‚ÄîI‚Äôm always looking for the \"why\" behind the process. I aim for complete, long-term solutions.\n\nI focus on creating scalable, maintainable solutions. My background as a backend software engineer taught me the importance of high data quality. This experience made me more versatile when I transitioned back into Data Science, shifting my approach from ad-hoc scripts to a structured, end-to-end mindset.\n\nI have experience in machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning, paired with a strong interest in DevOps and MLOps. I‚Äôm proficient with tools like Snowflake, AWS and Gitlab. I led a backend project supporting 500 weekly active users. I‚Äôve developed a custom Siamese Network to detect similarity patterns in over 3 million data points and implemented a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that improved anomaly detection. My approach in a data science project is to understand the end-user and customer first and get clarity about the data.\n\nCollaboration energizes me, especially when working in cross-functional teams. I enjoy being the bridge between technical and non-technical stakeholders.. I‚Äôm not afraid to take the lead and responsibility when needed.\n\nOutside of work, I‚Äôm passionate about football‚Äîwhether playing, watching, or analyzing it. To clear my mind, I enjoy cycling or running in the summer, and skiing or ice skating in the winter. Furthermore I‚Äôm learning both Swedish and Spanish as additional languages. I keep up with the latest developments in data and AI by reading newsletters and visiting tech websites in the evenings.\n\nMy dream is to eventually combine my passion for data and AI with football. Inspired by the Moneyball principle, I hope to one day be part of a team that uses data to drive decisions and performance in the sport.",

Shortly after college i also discovered an interest in programming backend systems, and i've come to love to experiment with and implement interesting game mechanics, algorithms, AI, and backend systems for web projects.\nWhen it comes to game mechanics in particular, the more reality-challenging the better!\n\nWorking on a project together with passionate people and being able to contribute to realizing a digital, interactive system is something i find great joy in, and i always make sure to bring my \"A-game\" to every team and task i get to take on. Software development and playing games are the two foremost aspects of life where i feel i'm in my element.\n\nThe following are some of the software and programming languages i've interacted with and learned during the years:\n* AI and procedural generation techniques:\n\t* Finite State Machine, Minimax, Steeringbehaviors, L-Systems, Marching Cubes, A* pathfinding, various sorting algorithms, and various dungeon/labyrinth generation algorithms.\n* Unity and C#\n* Unreal Engine and C++\n* ASP.NET Core and SQL\n* Node, ReactJS, and Javascript/Typescript.\n\nMy biggest accomplishments so far include being awarded the diploma for \"Programmer of the Year\" when i matriculated from gymnasium, the fact that i've acquired a bachelor's degree as well as having been a part of developing a horror game called \"Forgive Me\" during a college project which became decently popular.\n\nI always look forward to being a part of and contributing to a new software project. Right now i'm in-between studies and work and i'm actively exploring the world of software development on my own with various private projects. If i seem like an interesting guy, don't hesitate to send me a message or email!",

It‚Äôs a job about meeting people and find a way to collaborate together with the patient but also with colleagues. But I missed something in my previous work, the stimulation from solving a tricky puzzle and to have my power of change in my own hands.\n\nI‚Äôm intrigued by the fact that as a developer you‚Äôre never done learning. There‚Äôs always new things to learn and it‚Äôs important to keep up with the industry. I‚Äôm a fast learner and I feel very satisfied with myself when I learn new things.\n\nWho am I as a person then? \nI‚Äôm the one who loves helping others. I‚Äôm the one who is seeing more solutions than problems. I‚Äôm usually the one who smiles a lot and likes to joke around, but also have a good sense of when to be professional.
